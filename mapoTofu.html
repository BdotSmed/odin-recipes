                <p>Mapo tofu should be known to be the "div" in Sichuan cuisine. It is just amazing, the perfect amount of spice, the structure behind how it is made and how all of the ingredients come together is just dangerously addictive. This dish also can combine a choice of your personal protein, if desired like ground pork, beef, or even plant-based "display: flex;" options. Do not even get me started on the numbing Sichuan peppercorns, such peppercorns that have the ability to make your brain just tingle, and if you have not expierened that feeling before... the Mapo Tofy is THE dish to try to expierence such phenomenon. These things that are basically just inline CSS for your soul. This kind of meal does not just render on your plate, it TRANSITIONS smoothly into your sensory BODY expierence. You do not jsut eat Mapot Tofu... mind you, this will "import" not just in your mind but your soul and you will never look back the next time you see Mapo Tofu again.</p>

                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1/2 cup oil (divided)</li>
                    <li>1-2 fresh Thai bird chili peppers (thinly sliced)</li>
                    <li>6-8 dried red chilies (roughly chopped)</li>
                    <li>1/2 - 1 & 1/2 tablespoons Sichuan peppercorns</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons ginger</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons garlic</li>
                    <li>8 ounces ground pork</li>
                    <li>1-2 tablespoons spicy bean sauce</li>
                    <li>2/3 cup low sodium chicken broth</li>
                    <li>1 pound silken tofu</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup water</li>
                    <li>1 & 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon seasame oil</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon sugar</li>
                    <li>1 scallion</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>First, we toast the chilies. If you have homemade toasted chili oil, you can skip this step. Heat your wok or a small saucepan over low heat. Add half of the oil and throw in the fresh and dried peppers. Stir occasionally and heat until fragrant, about 5 minutes, ensuring that the peppers don’t burn. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Heat the remaining half of the oil in your wok over medium heat. Add the ginger. After 1 minute, add the garlic. Fry for another minute, and then turn up the heat to high and add the ground pork. Break up the meat and fry it until it’s cooked through. Add your ground Sichuan peppercorns and stir for about 15-30 seconds, taking care to not let it burn, as it will turn bitter if it does.</li>
                    <li>Add the spicy bean sauce to the mixture and stir it in well. Add the chicken broth to the wok and stir. Let this simmer for a minute or so. While that's happening, ready your tofu and combine the water and cornstarch in a small bowl.</li>
                    <li>Add the cornstarch mixture to your sauce and stir. Let it bubble away until the sauce starts to thicken. (If it gets too thick, splash in a little more water or chicken stock.)</li>
                    <li>Then add your chili oil from before—peppers and all! If you are using homemade chili oil, ONLY use the standing oil, as it's likely that you have salted it and you only want the oil, not additional salt. Stir the oil into the sauce, and add the tofu. Use your spatula to gently toss the tofu in the sauce. Let everything cook for 3-5 minutes. Add the sesame oil and sugar (if using) along with the scallions and stir until the scallions are just wilted.</li>
                    <li>Serve with a last sprinkle of Sichuan peppercorn powder as a garnish if desired.</li>
                </ol>
