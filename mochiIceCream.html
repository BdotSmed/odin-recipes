                <p>Soft, chewy, and cold with just the right amount of ice cream. Strawberry mochi ice cream to me is a childhood home dessert of mine. It is well crafted just like how HTML and CSS is with no Javascript, choas or framework baggage or even the hyper train of AI. Mochi Ice-Cream in and of itself is just pure sweetness wrapped in simplicity. This in itself proves itself to be the best things in life (and code) that does not need to be in extreme abstraction.</p>

            <div class="Ingredients">
                <h2>Ingredients for Filing</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 & 1/2 - 2 cups vegan ice cream, of choice</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons strawberry jam (optional)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Ingredients for Mochi Dough</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 & 1/4 sweet glutinous rice flour, or mochiko sweet rice flour</li>
                    <li>1 cup strawberry, puree, from fresh or frozen strawberries</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup grandulated sugar</li>
                    <li>Few drops of pink food coloring (optional)</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup cornstarch/corn flour, or potato starch (or as needed)</li>
                </ul>
                
            
                <h2>Preparing the Ice Cream</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Line a small tray with parchment paper or place some cupcake liners in a muffin tin.</li>
                    <li>Optional: Dollop the jam onto the ice cream.</li>
                    <li>Use a small ice cream scoop or a spoon to scoop the ice cream into balls (about 2 tablespoons large). Try to make sure your ice cream scoops have no 'gaps'. Place the scoops on your baking tray or in your cupcake tin. Freeze the ice cream for 2 hours or until solid.</li>
                </ol>
                    
                <h2>Preparing the Mochi Dough</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Generously coat your work surface, hands and any utensils with cornstarch. Or you can coat your hands with oil. Divide the mochi dough into 12 parts.</li>
                    <li>Use a rolling pin to flatten each mochi ball into a flat round circle around 1/4 inch (6mm) thick. Each circle should be large enough for wrapping your ice cream. If the mochi dough sticks to anything, dust it with cornstarch.</li>
                    <li>Pick up one mochi circle and dust off any excess cornstarch. If desired, place the mochi circle in a small dish to hold it while you assemble the mochi. Place one scoop of ice cream in the middle of the mochi dough and quickly wrap the mochi around the ice cream. After you wrap the ice cream, if there's any excess mochi dough, cut it with a pair of scissors. Invert the mochi, place it in a cupcake tin then freeze. Repeat with the remaining mochi. Make sure you're wrapping only one mochi at a time while leaving the rest in the freezer.</li>
                    <li>Freeze the strawberry mochi ice cream for 1-2 hours.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Serving and storing the Mochi Ice-Cream</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>When you're ready to eat the mochi, let them sit at room temperature for around 5 minutes to let the mochi skin soften. If you eat them immediately, the mochi will be very hard.</li>
                    <li>Store leftover ice cream mochi in an airtight container for up to 1 week.</li>
                </ol>
