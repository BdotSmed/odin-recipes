## Project Description
  In this project, I built a website purely with the use of HTML and CSS to further my understanding on how websites are designed and created with the use of these tools. At the time of creating this project, the website may not look to be at its best condition however, this project again is to solidify and apply as to what I have learned when it comes to structuring the design of a webpage.

## What I have learned
  As mentioned in the prior section, this project was only built through the use of HTML and CSS. As this is my very first project in applying my knowledge in to a project, there were many things that I have learned when it comes to general front end development like, user accessibility, design fundamentals, meta tags, and also learning how to center a div :D

## What to expect in the later future
  As a note to myself, this project was to solidify and understand how front-end design works and how to properly organize the structure to a client side page. As I continue my studies in learning about front-end development, I will come back at a later time and learn how to implement even more unique stylings to this webpage specifically CSS (as it is my weak point).
